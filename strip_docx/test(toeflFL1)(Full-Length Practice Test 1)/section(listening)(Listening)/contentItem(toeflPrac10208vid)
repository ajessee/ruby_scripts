<para> (A) is correct because the function of the expression "but what about
the journal title" is to indicate that the librarian needs this information
to help her. (C) is attractive because earlier the student says she is having
trouble finding the information she needs, but the librarian is not implying
anything about her understanding of databases here. Neither (B) or (D) is
mentioned in the dialogue, nor are they implied in any way.</para>
