<para> The professor begins the lecture by stating that today's focus will
be on the differences between spoken and written language. Here, <emphasis
emphasis-type="italic"> focus </emphasis>has the same meaning as main point,
or main idea, so (B) is correct. (A) is incorrect because she does not focus
only on reading, nor does she address the pros and cons (positives and negatives)
of teaching it. (C) and (D) are sub-points, so they are not the main idea
of the lecture.</para>
