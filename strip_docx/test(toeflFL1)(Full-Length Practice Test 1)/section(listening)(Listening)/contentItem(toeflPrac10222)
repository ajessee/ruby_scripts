<explanation interaction="true">
<para> In the lecture, the professor states that the monk seal got its name
because it "tended to travel alone, like a monk" ( A). He adds that it had
a fold of skin that resembled a monk's hood (D), which means its appearance
also helped give it its name. The professor does not mention the time of day
it is active (B) or the discoverer (C) as reasons for its name.</para>
