<explanation interaction="true">
<para> (A) is correct because the function of the idiomatic expression "tell
me about it" is to indicate agreement, so the professor supports the student's
statement that the buses run late in the morning. The expression does not
request additional information (B), nor does it indicate that she does not
understand what he has said (C). There is also no indication that the discussion
will stop (D).</para>
