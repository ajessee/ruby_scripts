<para>           <emphasis emphasis-type="italic">             Agonistic Displays</emphasis>
       </para>
<para>           Animals exhibit many kinds of display behavior. Among the
most familiar are courtship displays used when animals intend to mate. Another
well-known set of display patterns are termed <highlightSpan id="toeflPrac10103_01"> agonistic</highlightSpan> ;
these are displays used by animals in situations involving attack, escape,
or fear. Scientists have discovered that there are three <highlightSpan id="toeflPrac10103_02"> discrete</highlightSpan> types
of motor patterns used as basic building blocks for agonistic displays, all
of which arise out of conflict between competing emotional motivations. Most
agonistic displays are derived from these three sets of motor patterns.<sentence-insertion-point
id="1"></sentence-insertion-point></para>
<para>           The first motor pattern consists of irrelevant actions, which
animal behaviorists call displacement activities. These are actions that appear
to be performed in inappropriate contexts. In one experimental setting, male
Wood Thrushes put in a position that required a choice between attacking <emphasis
emphasis-type="italic"> or </emphasis>fleeing would begin to scratch, or clean
their wings, eat,   or even sleep. Examples of a displacement activity in
humans would be chewing one's nails or drumming one's fingers on the table
when nervous, or whistling when scared. In such situations, there seems to
be a feeling that an action-any action-is called for, whether it is appropriate
or not. Displacement activities usually consist of actions normally associated
with parts of an individual's daily maintenance routine-actions such as preening,
scratching, yawning, stretching, and eating.</para>
<para>           The second motor pattern consists of actions performed in
the correct contexts, but directed towards the wrong objects, and are called
redirected activities. These are most common when an initial intention is <highlightSpan
id="toeflPrac10103_04"> thwarted</highlightSpan>, or otherwise unable to be
completed. <sentence-insertion-point id="2"></sentence-insertion-point>For
example, a male bird might be unable or unwilling to risk attacking another
larger bird invading his territory, and in stead peck at the branch upon which
he is perched. A dog on a leash might be tempted to bite another dog, but
restrained by its owner from doing so, <highlightSpan id="toeflPrac10103_05"> it</highlightSpan> tries
to bite its owner or a nearby object. An employee angry with his boss might
yell at a friend or relative. Redirected activities, like displacement activities,
arise out of conflict between motivations, and convey information about the
emotional<highlightSpan id="toeflPrac10103_06"> state</highlightSpan> of the
animal.</para>
<para>           The third motor pattern consists of uncompleted initial stages
of ordinary actions, called intention movements. Examples would be birds crouching
just before taking off, or someone making a fist before hitting another person.
The bird may not actually take off, and a person may not actually strike the
opponent, but the intent has been signaled. An emotional conflict arises out
of whether to follow through on the act once it has been signaled as having
begun. These intention movements reveal information about the animal's emotional
state.</para>
<para>           Displacement activities, redirected activities, and intention
movements all convey information about the animal's motivations and emotional
state. <sentence-insertion-point id="3"></sentence-insertion-point>Over time,
exaggeration and stereotyping ritualize these behaviors and incorporate them
into displays. The exaggeration and stereotyping of the components of a display
are important in creating unambiguous communication. If the movements vary
too much between individuals within a species, or in one individual over time,
then the information content becomes less clear.</para>
<para>           While the information content of an agonistic display may
be clear to the animals involved, it is less so to the scientists who study
displays. Several key questions about agonistic displays remain unanswered:
Do displays always reveal the true intentions of an animal? Do animals ever
use displays to bluff or lie about their intentions?</para>
<para>           Some scientists argue that it makes sense for animals to
bluff. <highlightSpan id="toeflPrac10103_010"> If a display signaling a readiness
to attack a rival over a food resource results in the rival's departure, then
it is worth signaling, even if there is no true resolve to fight.</highlightSpan> In
theory, an animal that always signals it intends to attack, regardless of
its actual intention, will initially win more contests than one that signals
honestly.<sentence-insertion-point id="4"></sentence-insertion-point></para>
<para>           However, other researchers have pointed out that if winning
contests plays a major role in gaining reproductive success, cheaters sending
false signals would spread through the population rapidly, Soon, others would
learn to ignore these signals. If the reliability of the information contained
in the display decreases over time, eventually there would no point in reacting
to it.</para>
<para>           Much more research is needed before scientists have a full
understanding of the complex information content and actual uses of agonistic
displays.</para>
