<para>           <emphasis emphasis-type="italic">             American Neoclassicism
and the U.S. Capitol Building</emphasis>         </para>
<para>           Visitors to America's capital city, Washington, D.C., have
long been impressed by its majestic, white stone buildings and one in particular:
the U.S. Capitol. With its lofty dome, triangular pediment depicting various
historical scenes, and supporting row of columns, the building hearkens back
to the temples of ancient Greece and Rome. These design elements, replicated
in countless public buildings in the capital and around the country, were
more than mere flights of fancy on the part of its designers. The building's
visionaries were attempting to anchor the young democracy to the very cradle
of Western civilization, while at the same time asserting the nation's own
unique identity.<sentence-insertion-point id="1"></sentence-insertion-point></para>
<para>           This incorporation of classic Greek and Roman <highlightSpan
id="toeflPrac10102_01"> motifs</highlightSpan> in art and architecture&mdash;neoclassicism,
as the movement came to be called&mdash;was not a novel idea at the time of
the Capitol's design. The emerging field of archaeology yielded several previously
undiscovered Roman ruins in the early 18th century, renewing appreciation
for Greco-Roman architectural sophistication. <sentence-insertion-point id="2"></sentence-insertion-point>Enthusiasm
for these physical forms was closely tied to the political and philosophical
principles the re resented: democracy and rationalism. This was especially
the case later in the century, as the ferment of democratic revolution grew,
and archaeologists made spectacular discoveries at Pompeii and Herculaneum.</para>
<para>           Imported from Great Britain, neoclassicism found expression
in the American colonies, primarily in New England, and in the buildings of
Edmund Woolley and Ebenezer Tomlinson. The Pennsylvania Statehouse (later
named Independence Hall) is an outstanding example of American neoclassicism
as <highlightSpan id="toeflPrac10102_02"> it</highlightSpan> existed before
the Revolutionary War, <highlightSpan id="toeflPrac10102_05"> Due to material
and technical limitations, innovations were mostly confined to detail and
ornamentation.</highlightSpan> It was not until after the Revolution and the
opportunity it afforded to fashion a capital city from the ground up that
American neoclassicism assumed its unique and monumental character.<sentence-insertion-point
id="3"></sentence-insertion-point></para>
<para>           The American statesman most responsible for this shift was
Thomas Jefferson, an architect in his own right. Unlike his New England compatriots,
Jefferson's classical inspiration came largely by way of France, where he
had spent a great deal of time before the Revolution and later as ambassador
under President Washington. In the throes of its own democratic revolution,
France similarly looked to the ancient world in erecting its new institutions
and monuments. Jefferson was awed by Roman ruins, as well as more recent constructions
that sought to resurrect not just the details, but the very scale and grandeur
of ancient Roman temples.</para>
<para>           Jefferson was emotionally and administratively involved in
almost all aspects of the capital's design and construction, including the
decision to entrust the task of planning the new city to tho French officer
Charles L'Enfant. Jefferson's sensibilities were also reflected in the design
for the capitol building, approved in a public competition in 1793. <sentence-insertion-point
id="4"></sentence-insertion-point>Submitted by William Thornton, the plan
was <highlightSpan id="toeflPrac10102_03"> reminiscent of</highlightSpan> the
Roman Pantheon, with its distinctive circular rotunda, colonnade and dome.
Jefferson's <highlightSpan id="toeflPrac10102_04"> fondness</highlightSpan> for
the style, and the dome in particular, could be seen in the way he fashioned
his own famous estate, Monticello. It is thus not surprising that this period
is alternately referred to as the Idealistic or Jeffersonian era of American
neoclassicism, and that the dome has become one of its defining features.</para>
<para>           <catRef-GRAD-UQTopic categoryName="rc.vocab"/> Before it
was completed in 1826, the Capitol building went through four a architects
and one complete reconstruction after being burnt to the ground by the British
in 1812. While its final form did not deviate greatly from Thornton's original
design, the building's final architect, Benjamin Latrobe, is credited with
imbuing the Capitol with a distinctively American sensibility. One of the
building's most admired features, said to have been suggested by Jefferson,
reflects this synthesis: the columns in the rotunda , whose orders were adorned
with American crops like tobacco leaves and corn. It is a fitting irony that
Latrobe, who has been given the title of America's first professional architect
and would go on to design some of the country's most celebrated edifices,
was an immigrant from England.</para>

American Neoclassicism: </emphasis>(B) Edmund Wooley and (D) the Pennsylvania
Statehouse are correct because paragraph 3 clearly states that Edmund Wooley
was one of the people who designed the Pennsylvania Statehouse "before the
Revolutionary War."</para>
<para>           <emphasis emphasis-type="italic">              Post-Revolution
American Neoclassicism: </emphasis>In paragraph 5, the Jeffersonian era (A)
is linked to the building of the U.S. Capitol, which expressed neoclassicism.
Benjamin Latrobe (E) was the Capitol's (F) final architect.</para>
<para>           <emphasis emphasis-type="italic">              None: </emphasis>(C)
is not mentioned in the passage. (G) is attractive because the Capitol is
"reminiscent" of the Pantheon; however, the Pantheon is not an American building,
nor is it neoclassical. (H) is not an answer because George Washington is
only mentioned briefly in the passage (he was president when Jefferson was
ambassador to France), and not in relation to neoclassicism.</para>

in American architecture. In the last paragraph the author notes that the
designs on the rotunda's columns reflect a distinctly American sensibility."
