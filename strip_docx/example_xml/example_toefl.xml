<para>           <emphasis emphasis-type="italic">             The Life and
Work of J.D. Salinger</emphasis>         </para>
<para>           Writer J. D. Salinger will always be remembered for his most
famous character, Holden Caulfield. The protagonist of the novel <emphasis
emphasis-type="italic"> The Catcher in the Rye</emphasis>, Caulfield became
the voice of <highlightSpan id="toeflPrac10101_01"> disaffected</highlightSpan> youth
not only for his generation-those coming of age in the early 1950s-but for
generations to come. The struggle to reconcile innocence and youth with the
pressures and expectations of the wider world is a theme that runs not only
through Salinger's work, but his life as well.</para>
<para>           Jerome David Salinger was born in New York City in 1919 to
an upper-middle class family. His father was a manager in a successful cheese
and meat importing company. As an adolescent, Salinger attended public schools
as well as a military academy.<sentence-insertion-point id="1"></sentence-insertion-point> He
dropped out of several colleges in New York, opting instead to immerse himself
in the Greenwich Village literary scene. This route paid off for Salinger;
he had his first work published in 1940 in <emphasis emphasis-type="italic">Story</emphasis> magazine,
after making the acquaintance of some of New York's most prestigious editors.</para>
<para>           Salinger's literary career, however, soon took a back seat
to events overseas. Despite a mild heart condition, Salinger volunteered to
fight in World War II and was sent to serve in Europe. One of the few bright
spots during his time in Europe was meeting the writer Ernest Hemingway, with
whom Salinger developed a lasting correspondence.</para>
<para>           While Salinger's experience of the war certainly left him
traumatized, when he returned to New York, he more or less picked up where
he left off. Before the war, he had started writing a series of stories about
a young man who suffers a nervous breakdown in the middle of Manhattan. <highlightSpan
id="toeflPrac10101_010"> These</highlightSpan> would later form the basis
for Salinger's first and only novel, <emphasis emphasis-type="italic">The
Catcher in the Rye</emphasis>, published in 1951.</para>
<para>           Parallels between Holden Caulfield's and Salinger's lives
are evident, especially as far as their educational careers are concerned.<emphasis
emphasis-type="italic"> The Catcher in the Rye</emphasis> begins with Caulfield
on the verge of expulsion from boarding school, after already having been
kicked out of two previous schools. He leaves his prestigious New England
prep school for a two-day adventure in New York City, and meets characters
from walks of life he had never encountered within his privileged milieu.</para>
<para>           What drew the <highlightSpan id="toeflPrac10101_02"> acclaim</highlightSpan> of
critics and readers alike was the authenticity of Caulfield's inner</para>
<para>           monologue. <sentence-insertion-point id="2"></sentence-insertion-point>He
is shown to be not just a "'rebel without a cause," but a thoughtful and clever</para>
<para>           young man, <highlightSpan id="toeflPrac10101_03"> astutely</highlightSpan> critical
of society and its "'phoniness," yet at the same time, desiring</para>
<para>           acceptance from it. <highlightSpan id="toeflPrac10101_011"> Some
critics have gone so far as to suggest that Holden Caulfield was the archetype
for modern "bad boy" culture heroes such as James Dean.</highlightSpan><sentence-insertion-point
id="3"></sentence-insertion-point></para>
<para>           Salinger would go on to publish numerous other stories in <emphasis
emphasis-type="italic">The New Yorker</emphasis> over the next decade. The
most famous of them, published in book form in 1961, was <emphasis emphasis-type="italic">Franny
and Zooey</emphasis>, about the relationship between a gifted brother and
sister who, each in their own way, struggle with the expectations of maturity.
Other noteworthy stories written in this period include: <emphasis emphasis-type="italic">Raise
High the Roof Beam</emphasis>, <emphasis emphasis-type="italic">Carpenters</emphasis> and <emphasis
emphasis-type="italic">Seymore, an Introduction</emphasis>.</para>
<para>           After <emphasis emphasis-type="italic">Hapsworth 16, 1924</emphasis> was
published in 1965, Salinger mysteriously withdrew from the public eye. Living
more or less as a recluse in rural New Hampshire, Salinger has ceased to submit
anything for publication, and rarely, if ever, gives interviews.<sentence-insertion-point
id="4"></sentence-insertion-point></para>
<para>           Some observers suspect that Salinger's withdrawal from society
is indicative of a mental breakdown of some sort; in this respect, at least,
perhaps Salinger has much more in common with his maladjusted characters than
most people may have realized.</para>
