<para>           <emphasis emphasis-type="italic">             The Life and
Work of J.D. Salinger</emphasis>         </para>
<para>           Writer J. D. Salinger will always be remembered for his most
famous character, Holden Caulfield. The protagonist of the novel <emphasis
emphasis-type="italic"> The Catcher in the Rye</emphasis>, Caulfield became
the voice of <highlightSpan id="toeflPrac10101_01"> disaffected</highlightSpan> youth
not only for his generation-those coming of age in the early 1950s-but for
generations to come. The struggle to reconcile innocence and youth with the
pressures and expectations of the wider world is a theme that runs not only
through Salinger's work, but his life as well.</para>
<para>           Jerome David Salinger was born in New York City in 1919 to
an upper-middle class family. His father was a manager in a successful cheese
and meat importing company. As an adolescent, Salinger attended public schools
as well as a military academy.<sentence-insertion-point id="1"></sentence-insertion-point> He
dropped out of several colleges in New York, opting instead to immerse himself
in the Greenwich Village literary scene. This route paid off for Salinger;
he had his first work published in 1940 in <emphasis emphasis-type="italic">Story</emphasis> magazine,
after making the acquaintance of some of New York's most prestigious editors.</para>
<para>           Salinger's literary career, however, soon took a back seat
to events overseas. Despite a mild heart condition, Salinger volunteered to
fight in World War II and was sent to serve in Europe. One of the few bright
spots during his time in Europe was meeting the writer Ernest Hemingway, with
whom Salinger developed a lasting correspondence.</para>
<para>           While Salinger's experience of the war certainly left him
traumatized, when he returned to New York, he more or less picked up where
he left off. Before the war, he had started writing a series of stories about
a young man who suffers a nervous breakdown in the middle of Manhattan. <highlightSpan
id="toeflPrac10101_010"> These</highlightSpan> would later form the basis
for Salinger's first and only novel, <emphasis emphasis-type="italic">The
Catcher in the Rye</emphasis>, published in 1951.</para>
<para>           Parallels between Holden Caulfield's and Salinger's lives
are evident, especially as far as their educational careers are concerned.<emphasis
emphasis-type="italic"> The Catcher in the Rye</emphasis> begins with Caulfield
on the verge of expulsion from boarding school, after already having been
kicked out of two previous schools. He leaves his prestigious New England
prep school for a two-day adventure in New York City, and meets characters
from walks of life he had never encountered within his privileged milieu.</para>
<para>           What drew the <highlightSpan id="toeflPrac10101_02"> acclaim</highlightSpan> of
critics and readers alike was the authenticity of Caulfield's inner</para>
<para>           monologue. <sentence-insertion-point id="2"></sentence-insertion-point>He
is shown to be not just a "'rebel without a cause," but a thoughtful and clever</para>
<para>           young man, <highlightSpan id="toeflPrac10101_03"> astutely</highlightSpan> critical
of society and its "'phoniness," yet at the same time, desiring</para>
<para>           acceptance from it. <highlightSpan id="toeflPrac10101_011"> Some
critics have gone so far as to suggest that Holden Caulfield was the archetype
for modern "bad boy" culture heroes such as James Dean.</highlightSpan><sentence-insertion-point
id="3"></sentence-insertion-point></para>
<para>           Salinger would go on to publish numerous other stories in <emphasis
emphasis-type="italic">The New Yorker</emphasis> over the next decade. The
most famous of them, published in book form in 1961, was <emphasis emphasis-type="italic">Franny
and Zooey</emphasis>, about the relationship between a gifted brother and
sister who, each in their own way, struggle with the expectations of maturity.
Other noteworthy stories written in this period include: <emphasis emphasis-type="italic">Raise
High the Roof Beam</emphasis>, <emphasis emphasis-type="italic">Carpenters</emphasis> and <emphasis
emphasis-type="italic">Seymore, an Introduction</emphasis>.</para>
<para>           After <emphasis emphasis-type="italic">Hapsworth 16, 1924</emphasis> was
published in 1965, Salinger mysteriously withdrew from the public eye. Living
more or less as a recluse in rural New Hampshire, Salinger has ceased to submit
anything for publication, and rarely, if ever, gives interviews.<sentence-insertion-point
id="4"></sentence-insertion-point></para>
<para>           Some observers suspect that Salinger's withdrawal from society
is indicative of a mental breakdown of some sort; in this respect, at least,
perhaps Salinger has much more in common with his maladjusted characters than
most people may have realized.</para>

more than mere flights of fancy on the part of its designers. The building's
visionaries were attempting to anchor the young democracy to the very cradle
of Western civilization, while at the same time asserting the nation's own
unique identity.<sentence-insertion-point id="1"></sentence-insertion-point></para>
<para>           This incorporation of classic Greek and Roman <highlightSpan
id="toeflPrac10102_01"> motifs</highlightSpan> in art and architecture&mdash;neoclassicism,
as the movement came to be called&mdash;was not a novel idea at the time of
the Capitol's design. The emerging field of archaeology yielded several previously
undiscovered Roman ruins in the early 18th century, renewing appreciation
for Greco-Roman architectural sophistication. <sentence-insertion-point id="2"></sentence-insertion-point>Enthusiasm
for these physical forms was closely tied to the political and philosophical
principles the re resented: democracy and rationalism. This was especially
the case later in the century, as the ferment of democratic revolution grew,
and archaeologists made spectacular discoveries at Pompeii and Herculaneum.</para>
<para>           Imported from Great Britain, neoclassicism found expression
in the American colonies, primarily in New England, and in the buildings of
Edmund Woolley and Ebenezer Tomlinson. The Pennsylvania Statehouse (later
named Independence Hall) is an outstanding example of American neoclassicism
as it existed before the Revolutionary War, <highlightSpan id="toeflPrac10102_05"> Due
to material and technical limitations, innovations were mostly confined to
detail and ornamentation.</highlightSpan> It was not until after the Revolution
and the opportunity <highlightSpan id="toeflPrac10102_02"> it</highlightSpan> afforded
to fashion a capital city from the ground up that American neoclassicism assumed
its unique and monumental character.<sentence-insertion-point id="3"></sentence-insertion-point></para>
<para>           The American statesman most responsible for this shift was
Thomas Jefferson, an architect in his own right. Unlike his New England compatriots,
Jefferson's classical inspiration came largely by way of France, where he
had spent a great deal of time before the Revolution and later as ambassador
under President Washington. In the throes of its own democratic revolution,
France similarly looked to the ancient world in erecting its new institutions
and monuments. Jefferson was awed by Roman ruins, as well as more recent constructions
that sought to resurrect not just the details, but the very scale and grandeur
of ancient Roman temples.</para>
<para>           Jefferson was emotionally and administratively involved in
almost all aspects of the capital's design and construction, including the
decision to entrust the task of planning the new city to tho French officer
Charles L'Enfant. Jefferson's sensibilities were also reflected in the design
for the capitol building, approved in a public competition in 1793. <sentence-insertion-point
id="4"></sentence-insertion-point>Submitted by William Thornton, the plan
was <highlightSpan id="toeflPrac10102_03"> reminiscent of</highlightSpan> the
Roman Pantheon, with its distinctive circular rotunda, colonnade and dome.
Jefferson's <highlightSpan id="toeflPrac10102_04"> fondness</highlightSpan> for
the style, and the dome in particular, could be seen in the way he fashioned
his own famous estate, Monticello. It is thus not surprising that this period
is alternately referred to as the Idealistic or Jeffersonian era of American
neoclassicism, and that the dome has become one of its defining features.</para>
<para>           <catRef-GRAD-UQTopic categoryName="rc.vocab"/> Before it
was completed in 1826, the Capitol building went through four a architects
and one complete reconstruction after being burnt to the ground by the British
in 1812. While its final form did not deviate greatly from Thornton's original
design, the building's final architect, Benjamin Latrobe, is credited with
imbuing the Capitol with a distinctively American sensibility. One of the
building's most admired features, said to have been suggested by Jefferson,
reflects this synthesis: the columns in the rotunda , whose orders were adorned
with American crops like tobacco leaves and corn. It is a fitting irony that
Latrobe, who has been given the title of America's first professional architect
and would go on to design some of the country's most celebrated edifices,
was an immigrant from England.</para>

<para>           <emphasis emphasis-type="italic">             Agonistic Displays</emphasis>
       </para>
<para>           Animals exhibit many kinds of display behavior. Among the
most familiar are courtship displays used when animals intend to mate. Another
well-known set of display patterns are termed <highlightSpan id="toeflPrac10103_01"> agonistic</highlightSpan> ;
these are displays used by animals in situations involving attack, escape,
or fear. Scientists have discovered that there are three <highlightSpan id="toeflPrac10103_02"> discrete</highlightSpan> types
of motor patterns used as basic building blocks for agonistic displays, all
of which arise out of conflict between competing emotional motivations. Most
agonistic displays are derived from these three sets of motor patterns.<sentence-insertion-point
id="1"></sentence-insertion-point></para>
<para>           The first motor pattern consists of irrelevant actions, which
animal behaviorists call displacement activities. These are actions that appear
to be performed in inappropriate contexts. In one experimental setting, male
Wood Thrushes put in a position that required a choice between attacking <emphasis
emphasis-type="italic"> or </emphasis>fleeing would begin to scratch, or clean
their wings, eat,   or even sleep. Examples of a displacement activity in
humans would be chewing one's nails or drumming one's fingers on the table
when nervous, or whistling when scared. In such situations, there seems to
be a feeling that an action-any action-is called for, whether it is appropriate
or not. Displacement activities usually consist of actions normally associated
with parts of an individual's daily maintenance routine-actions such as preening,
scratching, yawning, stretching, and eating.</para>
<para>           The second motor pattern consists of actions performed in
the correct contexts, but directed towards the wrong objects, and are called
redirected activities. These are most common when an initial intention is <highlightSpan
id="toeflPrac10103_04"> thwarted</highlightSpan>, or otherwise unable to be
completed. <sentence-insertion-point id="2"></sentence-insertion-point>For
example, a male bird might be unable or unwilling to risk attacking another
larger bird invading his territory, and in stead peck at the branch upon which
he is perched. A dog on a leash might be tempted to bite another dog, but
restrained by its owner from doing so, <highlightSpan id="toeflPrac10103_05"> it</highlightSpan> tries
to bite its owner or a nearby object. An employee angry with his boss might
yell at a friend or relative. Redirected activities, like displacement activities,
arise out of conflict between motivations, and convey information about the
emotional<highlightSpan id="toeflPrac10103_06"> state</highlightSpan> of the
animal.</para>
<para>           The third motor pattern consists of uncompleted initial stages
of ordinary actions, called intention movements. Examples would be birds crouching
just before taking off, or someone making a fist before hitting another person.
The bird may not actually take off, and a person may not actually strike the
opponent, but the intent has been signaled. An emotional conflict arises out
of whether to follow through on the act once it has been signaled as having
begun. These intention movements reveal information about the animal's emotional
state.</para>
<para>           Displacement activities, redirected activities, and intention
movements all convey information about the animal's motivations and emotional
state. <sentence-insertion-point id="3"></sentence-insertion-point>Over time,
exaggeration and stereotyping ritualize these behaviors and incorporate them
into displays. The exaggeration and stereotyping of the components of a display
are important in creating unambiguous communication. If the movements vary
too much between individuals within a species, or in one individual over time,
then the information content becomes less clear.</para>
<para>           While the information content of an agonistic display may
be clear to the animals involved, it is less so to the scientists who study
displays. Several key questions about agonistic displays remain unanswered:
Do displays always reveal the true intentions of an animal? Do animals ever
use displays to bluff or lie about their intentions?</para>
<para>           Some scientists argue that it makes sense for animals to
bluff. <highlightSpan id="toeflPrac10103_010"> If a display signaling a readiness
to attack a rival over a food resource results in the rival's departure, then
it is worth signaling, even if there is no true resolve to fight.</highlightSpan> In
theory, an animal that always signals it intends to attack, regardless of
its actual intention, will initially win more contests than one that signals
honestly.<sentence-insertion-point id="4"></sentence-insertion-point></para>
<para>           However, other researchers have pointed out that if winning
contests plays a major role in gaining reproductive success, cheaters sending
false signals would spread through the population rapidly, Soon, others would
learn to ignore these signals. If the reliability of the information contained
in the display decreases over time, eventually there would no point in reacting
to it.</para>
<para>           Much more research is needed before scientists have a full
understanding of the complex information content and actual uses of agonistic
displays.</para>
